# GetRidOf-WeDetectedAdblocker
If you visit a website with adblocker extension running, that website might show a popup saying "we detected adblocker, please disable it to see content".
This is my attempt to find ways to get rid of that popup without disabling adblocker extension. 

My plan is to develop an extension for the same, till then i will leep updating steps for each website i come across.
